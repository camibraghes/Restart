Restart

Restart is an application that contains two views with two buttons to switch between views, the first being activated by dragging, a custom button with complex gestures, and the second by clicking.
The first view contains 2 animations, the first is represented by dragging the title, the text and the button from the outside to the inside of the screen. The second contains the circular change of the position of the image at the same time as the change of position opposite the circles,a parallax effect and animation made by the user . 
The second view contains a single default created animation, and also contains text and normal or night background.

The main goal of this mini project is to inspire you on what I can accomplish with the SwiftUI framework.
